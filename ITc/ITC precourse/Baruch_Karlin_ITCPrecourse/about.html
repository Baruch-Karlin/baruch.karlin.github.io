        Coding is like solving a puzzle. Each slice of code is a piece of the puzzle that needs to fit perfectly with the rest of the code in order to receive a complete picture… I mean program. Solving a puzzle might sometimes be a bit difficult, you might get frustrated from trying to put together all the blues in the sky (why are they always in one shade???), but once you've succeeded in completing the puzzle there is no better feeling (and as a bonus you can hang it up in your living room).
